    Requires Facial Stuff and you should load it before this patch.

    This patch adds Facial Stuff support for Dwarves, Humans, Elves and Half Elves from the Lord of the Rims mods by Jecrell.

    Elves: No beards or wrinkles
    Half-Elves: Beards, no wrinkles
    Dwarves: No beards (they are added by the dwarves mod, not FS) and no mouths (beards in the way)
    Hobbits: No beards, No mouths because they don't fit on their face. I don't know how to scale or reposition eyes/mouth so they are a bit weird looking, but better than the blurry-eyed default hobbits.
